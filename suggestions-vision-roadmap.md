# Suggestions for vision.md and roadmap.md

## Changes made based on docs/issues.md

1. **Roadmap 8.5**: Removed all tier mentions (tiered rewards, T1/T2/T3, tier-increasing card effects, tiered insight). Kept stamina, phases, entry costs, deferred items, and implementation notes.
2. **Roadmap 11 (Scouting)**: Added note that scouting choices can increase encounter tier and reward tier.
3. **Roadmap 8.6 → 11.5**: Moved gathering balance pass from step 8.6 to step 11.5 (after post-encounter scouting). Expanded its scope to include Insight/research balancing.
4. **Roadmap 10**: Rewrote Research step. Replaced ModifierDeck/ResearchDeck/Variant-Choice/Affix-Picks system with: CardEffect discipline tags, Insight card effect (1-5 tokens, no encounter benefit), research encounters with choose/progress actions, exponential Insight costs by tier.
5. **Vision.md Research section**: Rewrote Learning/Research description and candidate generation to match new design. Updated Insight token definition, CurrentResearch token, discipline→token mapping, and encounter template for Research.
6. **Vision.md Scouting**: Added tier-increasing note to scouting risk/cost management section.
7. **Vision.md Mining**: Removed tier references from Mining description.

## Areas that could not be clearly derived from vision.md or roadmap.md

- The Insight card effect mechanic (grants tokens but no encounter benefit) was not described in either file. Now added to both.
- The research cost model (exponential by tier, 33% payment cap) was not described. Now added.
- CardEffect discipline tags were a new concept not in the vision. Now described in both files.
- Generalization of durability card effects across disciplines was implicit but not explicit. Now stated.

## Contradictions resolved

- vision.md described research using Thesis, Variant-Choice, Affix-Picks, and ModifierDeck workflow. roadmap step 10 also used these. The new design simplifies to Insight-only currency. Both files now align on the simpler model.
- vision.md Insight was described as "primarily generated by Learning/Research encounters" — now correctly describes Insight as generated by card effects across all disciplines.
- The old CurrentResearch token had a different payload structure. Now aligned with GameState-stored research state.

## General improvements to consider

1. **Thesis token**: vision.md still references Thesis in milestones section (line ~196). Consider whether Thesis is still needed or if Insight replaces it entirely.
2. **Variant-Choice / Affix-Picks tokens**: These tokens are still referenced in milestones and scouting sections. Consider clarifying their role now that research no longer uses them.
3. **ModifierDeck references**: Scouting section still references ModifierDeck for affix generation (vision.md lines ~318). Consider whether this is still the intended mechanic or needs updating.
4. **Research cards in Library section**: vision.md (line ~439) describes research cards being present in Library with counts. The new design adds completed research cards with 0 counts. Consider updating that section.
5. **Roadmap step numbering**: Steps use a mix of decimal (8.5, 9.1, 9.2, 9.3, 11.5) and whole numbers. Consider standardizing.
