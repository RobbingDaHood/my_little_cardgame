# When done with all of this then update the subbestions-vision-roadmap.md 

It represents suggested changes to vision.md and roadmap.md that would clarify them for the future. 

If I instructed you to do something that you could not read from those two files, then suggest how they can be changed to avoid that in the future. 

Also give me a list of contradictions and areas of improvements. 

Also, add a section about the copilot instruction file: for more code style kind of instructions suggestions. 

The last instruction in the suggestion file should be to delete all the content of the suggestion file.
