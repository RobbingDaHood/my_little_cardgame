# Audit issues to open on GitHub

Summary of automated scan for panic sites (unwrap/expect/panic):

- src/lib.rs: rocket_initialize().launch().await.expect("Failed to launch rocket");
  - Location: src/lib.rs:51
  - Notes: This `expect` is in the binary startup path; acceptable but flagged for manual review whether to handle error more gracefully in production.

No other `unwrap`, `expect`, or `panic!` occurrences were found in `src/` by automated grep.

Suggested next steps:
- Review the `expect` in src/lib.rs and decide whether to keep (fail-fast on launch) or convert to logged error with exit code.
- Create GitHub issues for any items that require follow-up (locking strategy for ActionLog, coverage gaps, snapshot+replay RNG tests).
