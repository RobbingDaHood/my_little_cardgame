# 0005 - Coverage threshold investigation

Summary:
CI enforces an 85% coverage threshold; local coverage runs previously fell short. Investigate low-coverage modules and either add focused tests or adjust the threshold after team discussion.

Tasks:
- Run coverage locally and identify files below threshold.
- Add targeted tests for low-coverage areas or propose a new threshold with justification.
