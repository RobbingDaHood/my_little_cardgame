# GitHub Copilot CLI Instructions for this Project

## Project-Specific Guidelines

### Testing Philosophy
- **Never expose private fields just for testing purposes**
- Tests should use the public API only
- For integration tests, use JSON strings to construct requests
- Test through HTTP endpoints, not internal methods
- Respect encapsulation at all times

### Code Quality Standards
- Follow Rust best practices and idioms
- Keep the current architecture (Rocket web framework)
- Maintain backward compatibility unless explicitly discussed
- All changes must have passing tests

### Testing Approach
- Integration tests go in `tests/` directory
- Use raw JSON for API requests (see `tests/api_tests.rs` for examples)
- Each test should be independent and isolated
- Test both success and error cases

### Commit Guidelines
- Use conventional commit format (feat:, fix:, refactor:, etc.)
- Provide detailed commit messages with bullet points
- Always run tests before committing

### Resource Constraints
- Limit premium model requests to zero
- Use standard/fast models only

### Development Workflow
1. Write tests first (TDD approach when adding features)
2. Make minimal surgical changes
3. Run tests to verify
4. Commit with descriptive message
5. Keep the project buildable at all times

## Current State
- Project uses Rocket 0.5 (RC version, planned for upgrade)
- Rust edition 2021
- Has basic integration tests in place
- Modernization plan exists in session storage

## Known Issues
- Some fields marked as dead code (unused but intentional)
- Using release candidate dependencies (to be updated)
- Minimal test coverage (being improved)
